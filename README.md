I like Python!  After years of working with all flavors of SQL, building databases, data warehouses, ETL processes and interesting reports, I discovered Python.  Now I spend most of my time learning and building projects in Python.

I've used git on small, local projects.  As I learn more about github, I plan on using it to host my projects as well.  There are also opportunities here to learn from others, contribute to open source projects and expand my network.
